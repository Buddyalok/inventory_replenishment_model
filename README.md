## Overview
This project is an **Automatic Inventory Replenishment Model** designed to help businesses optimize their inventory levels, minimize stockouts, and reduce working capital costs. The project leverages data-driven techniques to automate the process of determining when and how much inventory to reorder.


## Problem Statement
Maintaining the right level of inventory is a critical challenge for organizations.  
- **Overstocking** leads to high holding costs and locked working capital.
- **Understocking** increases the risk of stockouts, lost sales, and dissatisfied customers.

Manual inventory management is often inefficient, error-prone, and unable to adapt to demand variability and supply chain disruptions.

**Objective:**  
Develop an automated model that analyzes historical sales and inventory data, forecasts future demand, and generates optimal replenishment recommendations, balancing the risk of stockouts against the cost of excess inventory.

## Solution Approach

The solution involves building a data pipeline and predictive model with the following steps:

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Ingest historical sales, inventory, and lead time data.
   - Clean and transform data for analysis.

2. **Demand Forecasting**  
   - Use time-series forecasting (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning models) to predict future demand for each SKU.

3. **Inventory Policy Modeling**  
   - Implement inventory policies like (Order Quantity, Reorder Point) or custom policies based on business needs.
   - Calculate safety stock, reorder points, and optimal order quantities using demand forecast, lead time, and desired service levels.

4. **Automated Replenishment Recommendation**  
   - Generate actionable replenishment orders with recommended quantities and timing.

5. **Reporting & Visualization**  
   - Provide dashboards and visual reports to monitor inventory positions, forecast accuracy, and cost metrics.

## How It Works

1. **Input:**  
   - Historical sales and inventory data (CSV, Excel, Google Sheet or database).
   - Lead time information.
   - Service level targets and business constraints.

2. **Process:**  
   - Predict future demand for each product.
   - Calculate optimal reorder points and quantities.
   - Recommend replenishment actions.

3. **Output:**  
   - Recommended replenishment orders, safety stock levels.
   - Visualizations of stock positions and forecasted demand.

## Usage

- Update the data files with your own sales and inventory data.
- Adjust model parameters (forecasting method, service level, etc.) in the notebook or config files.
- Run the notebook to generate replenishment recommendations and reports.

---

## Results

- Reduced stockouts by X% (based upon the service level you will set)
- Lowered average inventory holding to safety level

---

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time data feeds (ERP/Inventory systems)
- Implement advanced forecasting models to predict near to actual growth %
- Add simulation for testing inventory policies under uncertainty
- Deploy as a web app or dashboard for business users
